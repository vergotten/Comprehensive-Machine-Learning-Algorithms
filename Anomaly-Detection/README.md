## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is a process in machine learning that identifies data points, events, and observations that deviate from a data set’s normal behavior. It’s used in various domains including cyber security, medicine, machine vision, statistics, neuroscience, law enforcement and financial fraud.

### Isolation Forest

Isolation Forest is an algorithm for anomaly detection that is based on the Decision Tree algorithm. It isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.
