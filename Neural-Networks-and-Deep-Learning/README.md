## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data.

### Perceptron

Perceptron: A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron or the simplest form of a neural network. It is a model of a single neuron that can be used for binary classification problems, which means it can decide whether an input represented by a vector of numbers belongs to one class or another.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network that generates a set of outputs from a set of inputs. An MLP is characterized by several layers of input nodes connected as a directed graph between the input and output layers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network designed for processing structured arrays of data such as images. Convolutional neural networks are widely used in computer vision and have become the state of the art for many visual applications such as image classification.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data. These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (nlp), speech recognition, and image captioning.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a deep learning architecture based on an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN). Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was created primarily for addressing sequential prediction issues. The LSTM networks can learn order dependence in sequence prediction challenges.

### Autoencoders

Autoencoders: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. An autoencoder employs unsupervised learning to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of reducing the dimensionality of the data.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): A generative adversarial network, or GAN, is a deep neural network framework which is able to learn from a set of training data and generate new data with the same characteristics as the training data.

### Word2Vec

Word2Vec: Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) published in 2013. The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence.

### BERT

BERT: BERT, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a machine learning (ML) framework for natural language processing.

### Transformers

Transformers: Transformers are a type of model architecture used in natural language processing. They are designed to handle sequential data, with the order of the data mattering, while also being able to consider the entire context of the sequence at once. This is achieved through the use of self-attention mechanisms. Transformers have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks in natural language processing.
