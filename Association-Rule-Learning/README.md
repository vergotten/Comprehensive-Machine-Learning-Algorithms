## Association Rule Learning

Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.

### Apriori

Apriori is a popular algorithm used in market basket analysis, for discovering frequent itemsets in transactional databases. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database.

### FP-Growth

FP-Growth is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets in a transaction database without candidate generation. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy aided by a prefix tree structure for storing compressed and crucial information about frequent patterns.
