## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.

### Clustering

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.

#### K-Means

K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.

#### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is where you build a cluster tree (a dendrogram) to represent data, where each group (or “node”) links to two or more successor groups. The groups are nested and organized as a tree, which ideally ends up as a meaningful classification scheme.

#### DBSCAN

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular learning method utilized in model building and machine learning algorithms. This is a clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a series of techniques in machine learning and statistics to reduce the number of random variables to consider. It involves feature selection and feature extraction.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique for dimensionality reduction that identifies a set of orthogonal axes, called principal components, that capture the maximum variance in the data.

#### t-SNE

T-distributed neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps users visualize high-dimensional data sets. It takes the original data that is entered into the algorithm and matches both distributions to determine how to best represent this data using fewer dimensions.

## Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data. Time series forecasting is the use of a model to predict future values based on previously observed values.

### ARIMA

In statistics and econometrics, and in particular in time series analysis, an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model is a generalization of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model. To better comprehend the data or to forecast upcoming series points, both of these models are fitted to time series data.

## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is a process in machine learning that identifies data points, events, and observations that deviate from a data set’s normal behavior. It’s used in various domains including cyber security, medicine, machine vision, statistics, neuroscience, law enforcement and financial fraud.

### Isolation Forest

Isolation Forest is an algorithm for anomaly detection that is based on the Decision Tree algorithm. It isolates observations by randomly selecting a feature and then randomly selecting a split value between the maximum and minimum values of the selected feature.

## Association Rule Learning

Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.

### Apriori

Apriori is a popular algorithm used in market basket analysis, for discovering frequent itemsets in transactional databases. The frequent itemsets determined by Apriori can be used to determine association rules which highlight general trends in the database.

### FP-Growth

FP-Growth is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets in a transaction database without candidate generation. It uses a divide-and-conquer strategy aided by a prefix tree structure for storing compressed and crucial information about frequent patterns.

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks are a set of algorithms, modeled loosely after the human brain, that are designed to recognize patterns. They interpret sensory data through a kind of machine perception, labeling or clustering raw input. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data.

### Perceptron

Perceptron: A perceptron is a type of artificial neuron or the simplest form of a neural network. It is a model of a single neuron that can be used for binary classification problems, which means it can decide whether an input represented by a vector of numbers belongs to one class or another.

### Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)

Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP): A multilayer perceptron (MLP) is a feedforward artificial neural network that generates a set of outputs from a set of inputs. An MLP is characterized by several layers of input nodes connected as a directed graph between the input and output layers.

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): A convolutional neural network, or CNN, is a deep learning neural network designed for processing structured arrays of data such as images. Convolutional neural networks are widely used in computer vision and have become the state of the art for many visual applications such as image classification.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a type of artificial neural network which uses sequential data or time series data. These deep learning algorithms are commonly used for ordinal or temporal problems, such as language translation, natural language processing (nlp), speech recognition, and image captioning.

### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a deep learning architecture based on an artificial recurrent neural network (RNN). Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) was created primarily for addressing sequential prediction issues. The LSTM networks can learn order dependence in sequence prediction challenges.

### Autoencoders

Autoencoders: An autoencoder is a type of artificial neural network used to learn efficient codings of unlabeled data, typically for the purpose of dimensionality reduction. An autoencoder employs unsupervised learning to learn a representation (encoding) for a set of data, typically for the purpose of reducing the dimensionality of the data.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)

Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): A generative adversarial network, or GAN, is a deep neural network framework which is able to learn from a set of training data and generate new data with the same characteristics as the training data.

### Word2Vec

Word2Vec: Word2vec is a technique for natural language processing (NLP) published in 2013. The word2vec algorithm uses a neural network model to learn word associations from a large corpus of text. Once trained, such a model can detect synonymous words or suggest additional words for a partial sentence.

### BERT

BERT: BERT, short for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is a machine learning (ML) framework for natural language processing.

### Transformers

Transformers: Transformers are a type of model architecture used in natural language processing. They are designed to handle sequential data, with the order of the data mattering, while also being able to consider the entire context of the sequence at once. This is achieved through the use of self-attention mechanisms. Transformers have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks in natural language processing.

## Recommender Systems

A recommender system, or a recommendation system, is a subclass of information filtering system that provides suggestions for items that are most pertinent to a particular user. Recommender systems are used in a variety of areas, with commonly recognized examples taking the form of playlist generators for video and music services, product recommenders for online stores, or content recommenders for social media platforms and open web content recommenders. These systems can operate using a single type of input, like music, or multiple inputs within and across platforms like news, books, and search queries.

### Content-Based Filtering

Content-Based Filtering: This approach uses item features to recommend other items similar to what the user likes, based on their previous actions or explicit feedback.

### Collaborative Filtering

Collaborative Filtering: Recommender systems using this method recommend items based on similarity measures between users and/or items. The basic assumption is that users with similar interests have common preferences.

### Hybrid Systems

Hybrid Systems: These systems combine two or more recommender strategies, using the advantages of each in different ways to make recommendations.

### Knowledge-Based Systems

Knowledge-Based Systems: A knowledge-based system (KBS) is a computer program that reasons and uses a knowledge base to solve complex problems.

### Contextual Systems

Contextual Systems: The term system context refers to the environment of your system. A system to be developed never stands on its own but is connected to its environment.

### Demographic-Based Systems

Demographic-Based Systems: These systems use demographic data such as age, gender, income, etc., to make recommendations.

### Social Network Based Systems

Social Network Based Systems: Social networking systems are web-based systems that aim to create and support specific types of relationships between people.

### Sequence-Based Systems

Sequence-Based Systems: In these systems, each software release is assigned a unique identifier that consists of one or more sequences of numbers or letters.

### Reinforcement-Based Systems

Reinforcement-Based Systems: Reinforcement systems are methods to provide consequences following particular behaviors.

### Deep Learning Based Systems

Deep Learning Based Systems: These systems use deep learning models to make recommendations. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning where artificial neural networks, algorithms inspired by the human brain, learn from large amounts of data.
