## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision.

### Clustering

Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups.

#### K-Means

K-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster.

#### Hierarchical Clustering

Hierarchical clustering is where you build a cluster tree (a dendrogram) to represent data, where each group (or “node”) links to two or more successor groups. The groups are nested and organized as a tree, which ideally ends up as a meaningful classification scheme.

#### DBSCAN

DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a popular learning method utilized in model building and machine learning algorithms. This is a clustering method that is used in machine learning to separate clusters of high density from clusters of low density.

### Dimensionality Reduction

Dimensionality reduction is a series of techniques in machine learning and statistics to reduce the number of random variables to consider. It involves feature selection and feature extraction.

#### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique for dimensionality reduction that identifies a set of orthogonal axes, called principal components, that capture the maximum variance in the data.

#### t-SNE

T-distributed neighbor embedding (t-SNE) is a dimensionality reduction technique that helps users visualize high-dimensional data sets. It takes the original data that is entered into the algorithm and matches both distributions to determine how to best represent this data using fewer dimensions.
